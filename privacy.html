        <h1>Privacy Policy & Data Protocol</h1>
        <div class="subtitle">Effective Date: February 12, 2026 | Protocol Version 2.4</div>
    </header>

    <div class="content">
        <p><strong>DON SYSTEMS</strong> ("we," "our," or "us") operates the website <strong>https://waterinmyspeaker.com</strong> (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>
        
        <p>We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.</p>

        <h2>1. The "Zero-Knowledge" Audio Architecture</h2>
        <p>Unlike other utility applications, our core technology (the "Frequency Generator") operates entirely on the client-side (your local device) via the Web Audio API. This is a critical distinction for your privacy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Audio Uploads:</strong> The sounds you hear are mathematically generated by your browser's CPU in real-time. No audio files are downloaded to or uploaded from your device.</li>
            <li><strong>No Microphone Access:</strong> Our "Speaker Test" and cleaning modes do strictly output-only operations. We do not request, require, or utilize microphone permissions. We cannot listen to you, record you, or analyze your environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Execution:</strong> The JavaScript code runs within your browser's sandbox. The "cleaning cycle" does not send telemetry data about your specific hardware health to our servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
        <p>While the core tool is local, we collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.</p>

        <h3>Types of Data Collected:</h3>
        
        <h4>A. Usage Data (Telemetry)</h4>
        <p>We may also collect information on how the Service is accessed and used ("Usage Data"). This Usage Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.</p>
        
        <h4>B. Cookies and Tracking Data</h4>
        <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our Service and hold certain information. Cookies are files with small amount of data which may include an anonymous unique identifier.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> We use Session Cookies to operate our Service.</li>
            <li><strong>Preference Cookies:</strong> We use Preference Cookies to remember your preferences and various settings (such as your Volume Calibration settings or Language Selection).</li>
            <li><strong>Security Cookies:</strong> We use Security Cookies for security purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Our "Day Streak" and "Total Cleans" counters are stored in your browser's Local Storage (`localStorage`). This data persists on your device and is never transmitted to our database.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Google AdSense & DoubleClick Cookie</h2>
        <p>We use Google AdSense to display advertisements on our site. Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our Service.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our Service or other websites on the Internet.</li>
            <li>You may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick Cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/" target="_blank" style="color:var(--accent);">Google Ads Settings</a> page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website or other websites. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.</p>

        <h2>4. Use of Data</h2>
        <p>DON SYSTEMS uses the collected data for various purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide and maintain the Service</li>
            <li>To notify you about changes to our Service</li>
            <li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of our Service when you choose to do so</li>
            <li>To provide customer care and support</li>
            <li>To provide analysis or valuable information so that we can improve the Service</li>
            <li>To monitor the usage of the Service</li>
            <li>To detect, prevent and address technical issues</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Transfer of Data</h2>
        <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>If you are located outside United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

        <h2>6. Security of Data</h2>
        <p>The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2>7. Service Providers</h2>
        <p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used. These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

        <h3>Analytics</h3>
        <p>We may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service. <strong>Google Analytics</strong> is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.</p>

        <h2>8. Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>

        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We will let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, prior to the change becoming effective and update the "effective date" at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for changes.</p>
