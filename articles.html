         <h2>Why You Should NEVER Put a Wet Phone in Rice</h2>
         <p>For decades, the "bag of rice" trick has been the go-to advice for water-damaged electronics. However, in 2024, Apple and Samsung officially updated their support guidelines to warn <strong>against</strong> this practice. Why? Because it does more harm than good.</p>
         
         <h3>The Starch Dust Problem</h3>
         <p>Uncooked rice is covered in microscopic starch dust. When you place a wet phone into a bag of rice, this dust mixes with the moisture to create a thick, glue-like paste. This paste can lodge itself into:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>The charging port (preventing cable connection).</li>
             <li>The speaker grill (permanently muffling audio).</li>
             <li>The microphone array (ruining call quality).</li>
         </ul>
 
         <h3>The Better Alternative: Airflow & Frequency</h3>
         <p>Instead of absorbents, modern smartphones need <strong>airflow</strong> and <strong>ejection</strong>. Gravity is your best friend. Place the phone upright with the ports facing down. Then, use a <strong>165Hz Ejection Tone</strong>. This frequency vibrates the water molecules violently enough to break their surface tension, allowing them to drip out naturally without introducing foreign contaminants like rice dust.</p>

         <h2>How to Eject Water from AirPods and Galaxy Buds</h2>
         <p>Wireless earbuds are notoriously difficult to clean because they lack large batteries to drive powerful bass vibrations. However, they are highly susceptible to sweat and rain damage during workouts.</p>
 
         <h3>The "Centrifugal" Method</h3>
         <p>Since AirPods have small drivers, acoustic ejection needs physical help. We recommend a hybrid approach:</p>
         <ol style="margin-left:20px; color:#aaa; font-size:14px; margin-bottom:15px;">
             <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect your earbuds to this device via Bluetooth.</li>
             <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Set our tool to <strong>"High Pitch / 1200Hz"</strong> (available in the Dust Mode). High frequencies travel better through the smaller mesh of earbuds.</li>
             <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> While the sound plays, hold the earbud by the stem and gently shake it downward. The vibration loosens the water, and the centrifugal force of the shake expels it.</li>
         </ol>
 
         <h3>Warning: Charging Cases</h3>
         <p>Never put wet earbuds back into their charging case. The case usually has <strong>zero water resistance</strong>. Even a drop of sweat on the charging contacts can corrode the copper pins, destroying the case's ability to charge.</p>

         <h2>Understanding IP67 vs. IP68: Is Your Phone Actually Waterproof?</h2>
         <p>Marketing terms like "Waterproof" are misleading. In the engineering world, we use the <strong>Ingress Protection (IP)</strong> scale. Knowing your rating is critical to knowing if your device can survive a swim.</p>
 
         <h3>The First Digit: Dust</h3>
         <p>Almost all modern flagships are "IP6x". The '6' means they are dust-tight. However, as we discuss in our "Dust Integrity" section, this seal degrades over time as the adhesive ages.</p>
 
         <h3>The Second Digit: Water</h3>
         <ul>
             <li><strong>IPx7 (iPhone XR, Older Pixels):</strong> Submersion up to 1 meter for 30 minutes. Good for a toilet drop or rain, but bad for swimming pools (pressure).</li>
             <li><strong>IPx8 (iPhone 15, S24 Ultra):</strong> Submersion beyond 1 meter (usually 1.5m to 6m) for 30 minutes. These can survive a shallow dive.</li>
         </ul>
 
         <h3>The "Speaker Trap"</h3>
         <p>Even with IP68, the speaker <strong>must</strong> have a hole to let sound out. Water can enter this hole but is stopped by a mesh barrier. While the water won't fry the motherboard, it sits on top of the mesh, blocking sound waves. This is why a waterproof phone still sounds broken after a swim—it's not broken, it's just blocked. Our tool clears this blockage.</p>

         <h2>The Silent Killer: Salt Water & Chlorinated Pools</h2>
         <p>If you dropped your phone in the ocean or a swimming pool, simple drying is not enough. <strong>Salt and Chlorine are corrosive.</strong></p>
